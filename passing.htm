<OL TYPE=A>
<P><LI>Modules which begin an outside passing track, or which have a 
crossover between the outside main and the outside passing track 
shall have a switch to control the outside passing track. This 
switch is to be mounted on the edge of the module opposite to 
the mainlines, directly across from the start of the section of 
passing track which that switch controls. Please see Figure 5.</P>

<P><LI>Outside passing tracks are to be wired and gapped as 
indicated in Figures 5 and 6.</P>

<P><LI>If an inside passing track comes to either end of a 
module, an interconnect wire is to be attached to the rails just 
before they stop at the end of the module or module group.</P> 

<P><LI>Inside passing tracks are to be wired and gapped as indicated 
in Figure 7.</P>

<P><LI>Switches are mounted on plates attached to the inside face of the
1x4" frame member on the rear of the module.  This prevents damage when
transporting the module.</P>

22 or 24 gauge</P>

track.  Outside passing tracks will always have a double pole, single throw
switch at their beginning.</P>

<P><LI>Double pole, double throw, center off switches controlling power to
outside passing tracks.  These switches allow the passing track to be run off
the mainline current, the current from the preceding passing track section,
or shut off.</P>

<P><LI>6-pin connector at the ends of modules to carry current for the
outside passing track, outside mainline, and inside mainline.</P>
