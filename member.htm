rights and privileges.  An Active Member may fully participate in any CVL
activity.  An <I>Active Member Status</I> is initiated by an individual who

becoming an Active Member or maintaining an already Active Member Statues
while attending a monthly membership meeting.  Active Member Status begins
(or is renewed) at the next membership meeting and lasts for a period of one
year.</P>

<P>If an individual has not initialed (or added their name to) a membership
roster at least once in 12 consecutive months, then that individual shall be
considered an <I>Inactive Member</I>. Although still listed on the CVL
Membership Roster, an Inactive Member does not have any voting privileges
and may not necessarily participate in all CVL activities, including
membership meetings.  Reinstatement to Active Member Status is available to
an Inactive Member by following the procedure stated herein under the
section titled <B>Active Member, Active Member Status</B>.</P>

<P>An individual may be removed from the CVL Membership Roster and requested
to not participate in any CVL activities, only at a monthly membership
meeting following a full discussion of such removal and only after a
majority vote for such removal by the Active Members in attendance at the
meeting.</P>
