erected: 40" to the top of the mainline roadbed.</P>

<P><LI>Modules shall be constructed so that the front edges of all 
modules are in line.</P>

<P><LI>Legs shall be made from 2x2 lumber 38 1/2" long. (See figure 
3.)  Legs are bolted to the sides of the module with 1/4-20 x 2 
1/2" carriage bolts, 1/4-20 wing nuts and 1/4" fender washers.  
For height adjustments, 1/4-20 x 2 1/2" hex head bolts in 1/4-20 
'Tee-nuts' shall be installed in the bottom of each leg. (See 
figure 3.) The Tee nuts shall be cemented into the legs to 
prevent their loss.</P>

use of two 2" size 'C' clamps at each interface.</P>

<CENTER><H3>Figure 1 - Standard 4' Module</H3></CENTER>
<BR><BR>

<P>This what a standard module looks like in its most basic form.  It has a
1/2" plywood and a standard 1x4 framework, glued and screwed together as
shown.  The legs are attached with wing nuts, so no tools are needed for
setup.  The module can be either 2' or 2'-6" wide and is 40" from floor to
the top of the roadbed.</P>

<P>The module has proven tohave good stability once assembled with other
modules in a layout.  No further bracing is desired.  (You may want to add
cross bracing when using it by itself at home.)  It is light, strong, durable,
simple to assemble and level, and it forms a stable foundation for your
trackwork and scenery.</P>

<P><LI>These 1 1/2" x 1 1/2" corner reinforcing blocks are screwed and glued
in place.</P>

<P><LI>These are the minumum and maximum standard widths.  Narrower modules
don't allow for enough scenery.  Wider modules are difficult to handle and are
hard to lean across to fix derailments.</P>

<P><LI>Modules wider than 24" shall have extra crosspieces, shown by dotted
lines.  Rule of thumb - 1/2" plywood should not span more than 24" in more
than one direction.</P>

weight of the module is supported by the side rails, which rest on the step
cut into the legs.</P>

<P><LI>The Tee nut goes into a 5/16" hole which is of 2 1/2" minumum depth.
All chips and dust must be removed from the hole before installing the Tee
nut.  Glue the Tee nut in place to prevent its loss.</P>

<P><LI>The wood screws are offset 1/4" vertically, so that they do not hit
each other in the glue block.</P>

gaps, dips, and bowing when modules are clamped together.</P>
