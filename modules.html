<CENTER><H4>Figure 1 - Standard 4' Module</H4></CENTER>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="figure1.gif"></CENTER>


<P>This what a standard module looks like in its most basic form.  It has a
1/2" plywood and a standard 1x4 framework, glued and screwed together as
shown.  The legs are attached with wing nuts, so no tools are needed for
setup.  The module can be either 2' or 2'-6" wide and is 40" from floor to
the top of the roadbed.</P>

<P>The module has proven to have good stability once assembled with other
modules in a layout.  No further bracing is desired.  (You may want to add
cross bracing when using it by itself at home.)  It is light, strong, durable,
simple to assemble and level, and it forms a stable foundation for your
trackwork and scenery.</P>

<P><LI>These 1 1/2" x 1 1/2" corner reinforcing blocks are screwed and glued
in place.</P>

<P><LI>These are the minumum and maximum standard widths.  Narrower modules
don't allow for enough scenery.  Wider modules are difficult to handle and are
hard to lean across to fix derailments.</P>

<P><LI>Modules wider than 24" shall have extra crosspieces, shown by dotted
lines.  Rule of thumb - 1/2" plywood should not span more than 24" in more
than one direction.</P>

All chips and dust must be removed from the hole before installing the Tee
nut.  Glue the Tee nut in place to prevent its loss.</P>

each other in the glue block.</P>

<h3>Corner Modules</h3>



<OL TYPE=A>
<P><LI>Corner modules shall be constructed as shown in figure 6.  
Curves on corner modules shall be constructed as shown in figure 
7.</P>

<P><LI>Corner modules with curves of greater radius are permissible. 
These modules or module groups must be the equivalent of a square 
with sides that are a multiple of two feet, at the point where 
the module or module group mates to the adjacent modules. For 
example, the standard corner module is the equivalent of a four 
foot square.</P>
</OL>

<P>The basic corner module is 1/2" plywood attached to 1x4" framework, as with
regular modules.  Widths and lengths of mating faces can very between the
limits shown.  Legs are attached as with standard modules, at the noted
locations. (<B>e</B>)</P>

<OL TYPE=a>
<P><LI>The front edge is 33" long, 32 1/2" with an outside passing track.</P>

<P><LI>The rear edge is 32" long, 25 1/2" if the 30" width is used.</P>

<P><LI>Corner braces are 2x2" blocks, 3 1/2" long.</P>

<P><LI>The light line shows a greater width module (25" instead of 24") which
is to be used whenever the outside passing track is to be applied.</P>

<P><LI>These small section os straight track just after the spanner tracks
produce needed spacing between curves and help prevent kinks between the
spanners and the module's trackage.</P>

<P><LI>The inside and outside passing tracks are optional.</P>
