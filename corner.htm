<OL TYPE=A>
<P><LI>Corner modules shall be constructed as shown in figure 6.  
Curves on corner modules shall be constructed as shown in figure 
7.</P>

<P><LI>Corner modules with curves of greater radius are permissible. 
These modules or module groups must be the equivalent of a square 
with sides that are a multiple of two feet, at the point where 
the module or module group mates to the adjacent modules. For 
example, the standard corner module is the equivalent of a four 
foot square.</P>

<P>The basic corner module is 1/2" plywood attached to 1x4" framework, as with
regular modules.  Widths and lengths of mating faces can very between the
limits shown.  Legs are attached as with standard modules, at the noted
locations. (<B>e</B>)</P>

<OL TYPE=a>
<P><LI>The front edge is 33" long, 32 1/2" with an outside passing track.</P>

<P><LI>The rear edge is 32" long, 25 1/2" if the 30" width is used.</P>

<P><LI>Corner braces are 2x2" blocks, 3 1/2" long.</P>

<P><LI>All frame members are standard 1x4", lengths as required.</P>

<P><LI>The light line shows a greater width module (25" instead of 24") which
is to be used whenever the outside passing track is to be applied.</P>

<P><LI>These small section os straight track just after the spanner tracks
produce needed spacing between curves and help prevent kinks between the
spanners and the module's trackage.</P>

<P><LI>The inside and outside passing tracks are optional.</P>

<P><LI>These are the standard spanner track gaps.</P>
