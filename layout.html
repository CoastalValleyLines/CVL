    <h3>Layout Operations Standards</h3>

    <div class='featurebox_center'>
   
<H4>Fun Run</H4>

<P>A <I>Fun Run</I> is an assembled CVL layout whose purpose is for all
members of the CVL, and their invited guests, to run their rolling stock and
other equipment on the layout in a "fun and informal" manner.  Such runs may
or may not incorporate "work in progress" modules, "trouble shooting"
sessions, testing of new or different control activities, let individuals
test and/or run new or special equipment, incorporate building projects,
include special interest activities, etc.</p>
<p>In general, a Fun Run is a CVL
activity to encourage member participation and Model Railroading activities
in an informal setting.</P>

<H4>Show Run</H4>

<P>A <I>Show Run</I> is an assembled CVL layout whose purpose is to present
the modules and equipment of the CVL members in a formal setting.  Show Runs
are designed for general public viewing of the layout.  CVL often asks for
and receives a fee for setting up a Show Run.  A Show Run incorporates only
finished and tested modules in the layout.</p>
<p>Active Members are encouraged to run the layout.  Inactive Members and/or guests and/or the general public
are not asked to participate in a Show Run.  Only Active Members are
encouraged to display and/or run their rolling stock and other equipment
that has been checked-in, documented, and approved to the CVL standards.
The rolling stock and/or other equipment of Inactive Members, guests, or the
general public is not invited to be displayed or run during a Show Run.</P>

<H4>CVL Member Participation</H4>

<P>Setting up the CVL modules for a run of any sort is one of the major
activities of the CVL.  The setting up, operation, and disassembly of the
layout is basic to a successful run and requires the teamwork of all who
participate.  Every participant should, to the best of their ability, help
with the set-up and/or disassembly of the layout of he/she expects to
participate in the operation of the layout.  It is expected that every
participant will operate and respect the layout, all rolling stock, and all
equipment as if it were their own.</P>

<H4>Operation, Direction, and Control of a CVL Run</H4>

<P>All design, coordination, setup, operation, theme, schedule, equipment,
assignment, and take-down decisions are made by the Run Coordinator.  The
Run Coordinator is an Active Member of the CVL.  The Run Coordinator is
encouraged to have at least one or more Assistant Coordinators to help in
these tasks.</P>

<P>In the event that there is a disagreement in any aspect of a CVL Run by
any participant of the Run, the appropriate course of action is to first
approach the Run Coordinator with the problem.  The decision of the Run
Coordinator will prevail the majority of the time.  If the Run Coordinator
so chooses, one or more other Active Members, and/or a member of the
Steering Committee may be asked for advice.  If the resulting outcome is
still in dispute, then an Active Member (and only an Active Member) may
present a written grievance to a member of the Steering Committee.  Then,
and only then, may a decision by a Steering Committee member override a
decision of the Run Coordinator.</P>
