<OL TYPE=I>
<P><LI><B>TRACK FEEDLINES</B></P>
<OL TYPE=A>
<P><LI>Track power is carried under modules using 18 gauge (or 
heavier) two-conductor brown lamp cord, type SPT only. Accept no 
substitutes for this type.  These cords shall be called 
feedlines.</P>

<P><LI>Track feedlines shall be firmly attached to the undersurface
of each module, and shall have at least one connection from the 
feedline to its track on the module. This connection is called a 
drop wire, and is to be no smaller than 24 gauge. The length of 
drop wires is to kept to a minimum. The feedline ends shall be 
able to extend one foot past the end of the module. Feedlines 
shall pass through, not under, any crossmembers under a module.</P>

<P><LI>If an outside passing track passes through, or begins or ends 
on a module, a feedline for that track shall be installed.  The 
feedline shall be double-ended if the outside passing track goes 
through the module.  Otherwise, it shall be single-ended. See 
<A HREF="passing.htm">Passing Tracks</A>.</P> 

<P><LI>The plugs used to interconnect mainline and outside
passing track feedlines are <B>TRW-Cinch #P306-CCT</B> (Male) and
<B>#S306-CCT</B> (Female) or other manufacturer's equivalents.</P>

<P><LI>Local control of mainlines must be approved by asking for a 
variance at a club meeting.</P>

<P><LI>A method of securing the ends of the feedlines under the 
modules for transport shall be provided (Safety cup hook,  
Velcro, string, ties, etc.).</P>
</OL>

<P><LI><B>POWER SUPPLY FEEDLINES</B></P>
<OL TYPE=A>
<P><LI>Layout power is carried under modules using 16 gauge (or 
heavier) two-conductor white lamp cord, Type SPT only. Accept no 
substitutes for this type. The ribbed conductor shall go to pin 
1 of the connectors.</P> 

<P><LI>The feedline ends shall be able to extend 12" past the end of 
the module.</P>

<P><LI>The plugs used to interconnect module power supply feedlines 
are <B>TRW-Cinch #P302-CCT</B> (Male) and <B>#S302-CCT</B> (Female) or other 
Manufacturer's equivalent.</P>

<P><LI>All taps off this feedline for power to wiring on modules 
shall be fused.</P>
</OL>
<LI><B>ELECTRICAL CONNECTIONS</B></P>
<OL TYPE=A>
<P><LI>All electrical connections shall be soldered and taped or 
otherwise insulated.  Terminal strips of the barrier type may be 
used in place of soldered connections.</P>

<OL TYPE=1>
<P><LI>Drop wires connecting rails mainline tracks to 
feedlines.  Rail closer to the front of the module is connected 
to the ribbed wire of the feedline cord. Use 22 or 24 gauge wire 
for drops.</P>

<P><LI>Drop wires are soldered directly to the side of the rails.</P>

<P><LI>Solder and insulate connections between drops and feedlines.</P>

<P><LI>Use 18 gauge brown lamp cord for mainline feedlines.</P>

<P><LI>Male 6-pin connector on left side looking at the front of the
module.  Pin 1 is the rail on outside passing track (if used) closest to
module edge.  Pin 2 is the inside rail of the outside passing track.  Pin
3 is the outside rail of the outside mainline, and so forth.</P>

<P><LI>Female 6-pin wired as above.</P>

<P><LI>Use 16 gauge white lamp cord for main power cord.</P>

<P><LI>Male 2-pin connector on left side when facing the front of the
module.  Pin 1 is connected to the ribbed wire of the cord.</P>

<P><LI>Female 2-pin connector wired as above.</P>

<P><LI>Allow for one foot of slack past the ends of the module.  Use
Velcro or other means to secure the ends during transport.</P>

<P><LI>Staples hold the wires to the bottom of the module.</P>
