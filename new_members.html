    <h3>Information for New Members</h3>

    <div class='featurebox_center'>
   

<P>The CVL (Coastal Valley Lines) is an informal association of novice to
expert model railroaders from around the Sonoma County area.  The group
operates its HO modular railroad at public and private events and also
gathers for clinics, worksessions, and regular monthly meetings.</P>

<P>The members all agree to use a set of standards (technical guidelines) for
the construction of their modules.  They also follow standards to prepare
their rolling stock (cars and locomotives) before operating them.  This
ensures reliable operation which helps up to have fun running trains!</P>

<P>The CVL does not have elected officers, dues, or bylaws because we want to
run trains; not "run and organization" or play politics.  Members share the
duties and responsibilities needed to accomplish club activities.</P>

<H4>CVL Basic Agreements</H4>
<P>To participate in the association, you must agree to:</P>
<OL TYPE=1>

<P><LI>Have fun running trains!</P>
<P><LI>Follow the standards.  Variances must be obtained from the membership
at club meetings.</P>
<P><LI>Assist in either setup or breakdown (both if possible!) of any show or
run that you participate in.</P>
<P><LI>Take your turn doing some of the assigned tasks during preparation
for and operation at fun and show runs.</P>
<P><LI>Operate all modules and equipment with care, as though they were your
own.</P>
<P><LI>Have at least one engine and ten cars which meet standards and which
you bring to be run at club events within a year of joining.</P>
<P><LI>Allow your modules and equipment (if present at a run) to be run by
all CVL members.</P>
<P><LI>Be willing to resolve differences by discussion and compromise.  Our
prime purpose is to have fun.</P>
</OL>

<P>If you are under 16 years of age, you must have a sponsor over 21 who
is a member to be with you whenever trains are being run.  (A person under
16 can be upgraded to regular member status after recommendation by the
sponsor and a two-thirds vote of the membership at a meeting.)</P>

<H4>Costs</H4>

<P>You do not have to pay dues to be part of the association.</P>

<P>The required locomotive and ten cars (of good quality) can be obtained
for under $120.  This includes the cost of adding approved couplers and
otherwise bringing the equipment up to standards.</P>

<H4>Optional Expenses</H4>

<P>A 2 foot long module can be built for as little as $30.  A module or
module group may be as expensive and extensive as you want, but build only
as much as you yourself can transport.</P>

<P>You may be able to save money by showing your ideas to other CVL members,
as they may have suggestions based on experience save money and assist in
the construction.  It is strongly recommended that you do this.</P>

<P>You must have flameproof curtain for the front and back of your modules.
We do bulk purchases of curtain when necessary at a cost of about $3 a
running foot.  Your curtain is added to the association's pool when your
module is ready to run.</P>

<P>Some members choose to own the type of throttle that we use to control
trains on the CVL layout.  These throttles are not available through hobby
stores, so the CVL members interested in having them occasionally get
together in a work session to make them.  They cost about $30 to construct.</P>

<P>Finally, many members buy 2-way FM radios for communication at shows.
These cost from $25 to $60.  (GE, Maxon, and Radio Shack offer various
models.)  CVL uses Channel "B" (49.845 MHz) as our main channel, but 5-
channel radios are preferred.</P>

<P>Liability insurance for the association is covered from the proceeds of
paid CVL show runs.  Additional moneys left over go to buy common equipment,
such as power supplies.</P>

<P>Costs of lodging, food, and transportation to shows would, in most
circumstances, be handled by each individual going to that show.</P>
