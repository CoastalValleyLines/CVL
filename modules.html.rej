+ Curves on corner modules shall be constructed as shown in figure

+ <P><LI>Corner modules with curves of greater radius are permissible. 
+ These modules or module groups must be the equivalent of a square 
+ with sides that are a multiple of two feet, at the point where 
+ the module or module group mates to the adjacent modules. For 
+ example, the standard corner module is the equivalent of a four 
+ foot square.</P>
