<P><B>MAINLINE AND PASSING TRACK SPECIFICATIONS</B></P>
<OL TYPE=A>
<P><LI>All modules shall have inside and outside mainlines. Passing 
tracks and any other trackage is optional.</P>

<P><LI>These tracks shall run level through the module.</P>

<P><LI>The track spacing and alignment at the end of the module or 
module group shall be as follows: (See Figure 4 and Figure 5, 
item A.) </P>   
<OL TYPE=1>
<P><LI>Outside passing  - 2 1/2" on center from the front edge.</P>

<P><LI>Outside mainline - 4 1/2" on center from the front edge.</P>

<P><LI>Inside mainline  - 6 1/2" on center from the front edge.</P>

<P><LI>Inside passing #1- 8 1/2"  on center from the front edge.</P>

<P><LI>Inside passing #2- 10 1/2"  on center from the front edge.</P>
</OL>
<P><LI>All of these tracks shall end 4 17/32" short of each end 
of the module or module group, so as to allow a 9" piece 
of track to span between modules.  This spanner helps to 
accommodate any variations in height and spacing.</P>

<P><LI>These tracks may curve, using the following guidelines:</P>
<OL TYPE=1>
<P><LI>They may not cross each other.</P>

<P><LI>Minimum radius of curvature is 60". Easements are optional. 
(Exception: <A HREF="corner.htm">corner modules</A> have their own
standards.)</P>

<P><LI>Minimum center-to-center spacing on these tracks on 
curves is to be 2 1/8". (Exception: <A HREF="corner.htm">corner modules</A>
have their own standards.)  (See Figure 5, item B.)</P>

<P><LI>These tracks may be no less than 2 1/2" from the center 
of the track to the nearest module edge.  (See figure 5, item C.)</P>

<P><LI>Within a module group, spanners may cross module gaps at 
angles, but must still be centered.  (See figure 5, item D.)</P>

<P><LI>These tracks need not be parallel.  (See figure 6, item E.)</P>

<P><LI>If there are curves of opposite direction in a module, 
or group of modules, a section of straight track at least one 
foot long shall separate the curves.  A spanner track may form 
part of this "S-curve preventer."  (See figure 6, item F.)</P>

<P><LI>All tracks shall run straight for 6" from the module mating 
face.  (See figure 5, item G.)</P>
</OL>
<P><LI>Roadbed may be between 3/16" and 1/4" in thickness.  The 
material used may be cork, wood, homasote or other suitable 
materials.</P>

<P><LI>All mainline and outside passing track trackage shall be code 
100 nickel-silver. Mainline spanner tracks shall be code 
100 nickel-silver.</P>

<P><LI>Ballast shall be Woodland Scenics Fine Brown, #B-72.</P>

<P><LI>Crossovers between mainline tracks, turnouts which end or 
begin an outside passing track, and crossovers between outside 
mainline and the outside passing track shall have a minimum frog 
# of 6.</P>

<P><LI>Tunnels and bridges shall not be closer than 6" to either end 
of the module, and if tunnels are longer than 18", direct access 
to tracks inside the tunnel shall be provided.</P>

<P><LI>Spanner tracks shall be standard Atlas 9" straight track 
sections. These sections are to be modified on one end so that 
rail joiners may be slid back all the way on the rail to 
facilitate installation of the spanner track. It is recommended 
that spanners be weathered and ballasted to match the tracks they 
will go next to.</P>

<OL TYPE=a>
<P><LI>A one foot "S-curve preventer" must separate any curves of opposite
directions.</P>

<P><LI>The minimum center-to-center spacing of tracks on curves is 2 1/2".</P>

<P><LI>Tracks may be no less than 2 1/2" from the edges of the modules.</P>

<P><LI>Spanners must be centered but may cross gaps in a module group at an
angle.</P>

<P><LI>All modules shall have inside and outside mainlines.</P>

</OL>

<P><B>Note:</B>  The large radius used ensures that long trains run smoothly
and do not have to contend with much more curve induced drag than the regular
corner modules already cause.  Due to this large radius, a 4' or 6' module
will only be able to shift its mainlines over about 3/4" or 3" respectively.
