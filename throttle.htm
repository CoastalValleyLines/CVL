<OL TYPE=I>
<P><LI><B>THROTTLES</B></P>
<OL TYPE=A>
<P><LI>Throttles are used for control of the mainlines and local 
control of trains on member's modules. The throttles are 
designed around the <B>LM317</B> voltage regulator, and must have a 
direction switch with a center-off position.  These throttles draw power
from the power supply feedline.  The plug on the throttle is to be a
<B>TRW-Cinch #P304-CCT</B> (Male) or other manufacturer's equivalent.</P>

<P><LI>Sockets on modules or control panels for  throttles are to be 
<B>TRW-Cinch #S304-AB</B> (Female) or other manufacturer's equivalent.</P>

<P><LI>Pins 1 & 3 of the throttle sockets and plugs are DC output from
throttle.  Pins 2 & 4 are power from the power supply feedline to the
throttle.</P>
</OL>

<LI><B>NON-STANDARD THROTTLES</B></P>
<OL TYPE=A>
<P><LI>If you must use a 115V AC powered throttlepack, its output 
(track voltage) is connected to pins 1 & 3 of the plug which will 
go into the corresponding 4-pin socket on the layout. No 
connections are made to pins 2 & 4 of the plug.</P>
</OL>
<BR>

<LI><B>THROTTLE FEEDS</B></P>
<OL TYPE=A>
<P><LI>Mainline throttles connect to the mainlines via a throttle 
feed fixture (spider). The spider has 2 and 6 pin male and 
female TRW-Cinch connectors to allow it to connect into the 
mainline and power supply feedlines, and also 4-pin sockets for 
the mainline throttles to plug into. See Figure 2 for 
construction of the spiders.</P> 
</OL>

<LI><B>CONTROL PANELS</B></P>
<OL TYPE=A>
<P><LI>All control panel switches shall be clearly labelled as to 
function, and if appropriate, positions.</P>

<P><LI>No control panel switch settings shall allow power from a 
module's local throttle to feed back into any outside passing or 
mainline track feedline.</P>

<P><LI>No control panel switch settings shall allow power from one 
main line feedline to be connected to another main line's 
feedline.</P>

<P><LI>Refer to figure 3 and 4 for recommended practices for control 
panel wiring and construction.</P>

<P><LI>The master switch is a double pole, double throw, center off toggle
switch.  The illustrated configuration allows the module to be run from the
throttle or "slaved" to the inside mainline power.

location of the turnout.</P>
