    <h3>Membership Standards</h3>

    <div class='featurebox_center'>

<H4>Membership Roster</H4>

<P>The Coastal Valley Lines <I>Membership Roster</I> is the CVL record of
the name, address, phone number(s), identifying color code, and the
membership status of both Active Members and Inactive Members.</P>

<H4>Active Member, Active Member Status</H4>

<P>An <I>Active Member</I> of the CVL is an individual who regularly attends
the monthly membership meetings of the CVL.  An Active Member has all voting
rights and privileges.  An Active Member may fully participate in any CVL
activity.  An <I>Active Member Status</I> is initiated by an individual who
initials (or adds their name to) a membership roster with the intent of
becoming an Active Member or maintaining an already Active Member Statues
while attending a monthly membership meeting.  Active Member Status begins
(or is renewed) at the next membership meeting and lasts for a period of one
year.</P>

<H4>Inactive Member</H4>

<P>If an individual has not initialed (or added their name to) a membership
roster at least once in 12 consecutive months, then that individual shall be
considered an <I>Inactive Member</I>. Although still listed on the CVL
Membership Roster, an Inactive Member does not have any voting privileges
and may not necessarily participate in all CVL activities, including
membership meetings.  Reinstatement to Active Member Status is available to
an Inactive Member by following the procedure stated herein under the
section titled <B>Active Member, Active Member Status</B>.</P>

<H4>Removal From the CVL Membership Roster</H4>

<P>Inactive Members will be removed from the CVL Membership Roster after
being inactive for a period of one year.</P>

<P>An individual may be removed from the CVL Membership Roster and requested
to not participate in any CVL activities, only at a monthly membership
meeting following a full discussion of such removal and only after a
majority vote for such removal by the Active Members in attendance at the
meeting.</P>
