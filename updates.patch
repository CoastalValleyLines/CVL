     <h3>Guidelines for CVL Operations</h3>
 
     <div class='featurebox_center'>

+<h3>Layout Operations Standards</h3>     
+   
+<H4>Fun Run</H4>
+
+<P>A <I>Fun Run</I> is an assembled CVL layout whose purpose is for all
+members of the CVL, and their invited guests, to run their rolling stock and
+other equipment on the layout in a "fun and informal" manner.  Such runs may
+or may not incorporate "work in progress" modules, "trouble shooting"
+sessions, testing of new or different control activities, let individuals
+test and/or run new or special equipment, incorporate building projects,
+include special interest activities, etc.</p>
+<p>In general, a Fun Run is a CVL
+activity to encourage member participation and Model Railroading activities
+in an informal setting.</P>
+
+<H4>Show Run</H4>
+
+<P>A <I>Show Run</I> is an assembled CVL layout whose purpose is to present
+the modules and equipment of the CVL members in a formal setting.  Show Runs
+are designed for general public viewing of the layout.  CVL often asks for
+and receives a fee for setting up a Show Run.  A Show Run incorporates only
+finished and tested modules in the layout.</p>
+<p>Active Members are encouraged to run the layout.  Inactive Members and/or guests and/or the general public
+are not asked to participate in a Show Run.  Only Active Members are
+encouraged to display and/or run their rolling stock and other equipment
+that has been checked-in, documented, and approved to the CVL standards.
+The rolling stock and/or other equipment of Inactive Members, guests, or the
+general public is not invited to be displayed or run during a Show Run.</P>
+
+<H4>CVL Member Participation</H4>
+
+<P>Setting up the CVL modules for a run of any sort is one of the major
+activities of the CVL.  The setting up, operation, and disassembly of the
+layout is basic to a successful run and requires the teamwork of all who
+participate.  Every participant should, to the best of their ability, help
+with the set-up and/or disassembly of the layout of he/she expects to
+participate in the operation of the layout.  It is expected that every
+participant will operate and respect the layout, all rolling stock, and all
+equipment as if it were their own.</P>
+
+<H4>Operation, Direction, and Control of a CVL Run</H4>
+
+<P>All design, coordination, setup, operation, theme, schedule, equipment,
+assignment, and take-down decisions are made by the Run Coordinator.  The
+Run Coordinator is an Active Member of the CVL.  The Run Coordinator is
+encouraged to have at least one or more Assistant Coordinators to help in
+these tasks.</P>
+
+<P>In the event that there is a disagreement in any aspect of a CVL Run by
+any participant of the Run, the appropriate course of action is to first
+approach the Run Coordinator with the problem.  The decision of the Run
+Coordinator will prevail the majority of the time.  If the Run Coordinator
+so chooses, one or more other Active Members, and/or a member of the
+Steering Committee may be asked for advice.  If the resulting outcome is
+still in dispute, then an Active Member (and only an Active Member) may
+present a written grievance to a member of the Steering Committee.  Then,
+and only then, may a decision by a Steering Committee member override a
+decision of the Run Coordinator.</P>
