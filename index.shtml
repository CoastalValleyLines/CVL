        <p>The Coastal Valley Lines (CVL) is an informal association of novice to expert model railroaders from around the Sonoma County, California area. We operate our HO modular railroad at public and private events, and also gather for clinics, work sessions and regular monthly meetings.</p>
        <p>The members all agree to use a set of standards (technical guidelines) for the construction of their modules. Members also follow standards to prepare their rolling stock (cars and locomotives) before operating them. This ensures reliable operation, which helps us to have fun running trains!
